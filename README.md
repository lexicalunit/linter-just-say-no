Hedge words make statements sound vague, or questions less confrontational. Overuse can negatively
affect your status in the workplace. Avoid hedge words in documents with this
[Atom linter][atom-linter] plugin!

# Why?

1. [Be more confident][just-say-no] &mdash; Take Ellen Leanse's advice with
   [a grain of salt][ellen-leanse] and consider if this reason resonates with you or the goal you're
   trying to achieve with your words.
2. [Avoid usage in scientific writing][bio-hedge] &mdash; Note that if you're looking for a more
   comprehensive writing tips linter, check out the fantastic [write-good-linter][write-good].
3. [Convey facts, not opinions][convey-facts] &ndash; "As a basic rule, try not to include more than
   one hedge term in a single sentence."
4. Tami Reiss released an extension for Google Chrome that operates similarly to `just-say-no`. The
   [Just Not Sorry][just-not-sorry] extension "warns you when you write emails using words which
   undermine your message".

# Controversy

Women are [stereotyped to be frequent users of hedge words][frequent-use] in the workplace. Hedge
words are not in and of themselves inherently good nor are they inherently bad. Looking at raw
numbers, [studies do suggest that women apologize more often][more-often] than men; yet that same
study attributes this to men that "think they've done fewer things wrong." When controlled for that
attribute, men and women apologize at the same frequency.

Whatever conversation style you use &mdash; due to socialization or wotnot &mdash;
**it's not your fault** if your coworkers treat you wrongfully for it. [Women should not have to
change they way they speak][force-change] to gain respect in the workplace. And they certainly
should **not** have to speak more like men to improve their standing. This plugin is just a useful
tool; I make no value judgements on anyone who uses it.
